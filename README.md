# SDV Farm Planner

## Description

The SDV Farm Planner is a tool that will help SDV players plan their farms conveniently. Using a grid based drawing system, players can layout different buildings, crops, and tools, and keep track of the number of items on their farm without the help of a farm computer in the file.

### Executing program

The program is currently split into two parts.
1. To run and see the three main pages of the website, open the file named index.html, about.html, or inspo.html located in the folder public in a browser.
2. To run and see the planner, open planner.html in the folder path public/planner in a browser.
